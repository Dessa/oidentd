oidentd v2.1.0 by Janik Rabe <info@janikrabe.com>
Originally written by Ryan McCabe <ryan@numb.org>

oidentd is an RFC 1413 compliant ident daemon that runs on Linux, Darwin,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, and Solaris. oidentd can handle IP
masqueraded/NAT connections on Linux, Darwin, FreeBSD (ipf only), OpenBSD,
NetBSD, and DragonFly BSD. oidentd has a flexible mechanism for specifying
ident responses. Users can be granted permission to specify their own
responses, and different responses can be sent depending on host and port
pairs.

For details on how to install oidentd see the INSTALL file.

For a complete list of features, consult the manual page or run oidentd --help.

The most recent version of oidentd will always be available at
ftp://ftp.janikrabe.com/pub/oidentd/releases/latest.
