Originally written by Ryan McCabe <ryan@numb.org>

oidentd is an RFC 1413 compliant ident daemon that runs on Linux, Darwin,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and Solaris. oidentd can handle IP masqueraded/NAT
connections on Linux, Darwin, FreeBSD (ipf only), OpenBSD and NetBSD. oidentd
has a flexible mechanism for specifying ident responses. Users can be granted
permission to specify their own responses, and different responses can be sent
depending on host and port pairs.

For details on how to install oidentd see the INSTALL file.

For a complete list of features, consult the manual page or run oidentd --help.

The most recent version of oidentd will always be available at
