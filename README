oidentd 2.3.2 by Janik Rabe <oidentd@janikrabe.com>
Originally written by Ryan McCabe <ryan@numb.org>

oidentd is an RFC 1413 compliant ident daemon that runs on Linux, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, and some versions of Darwin and Solaris.
oidentd can handle IP/NAT masqueraded connections on many operating system
kernels.  oidentd has a flexible mechanism for specifying ident responses.
Users can be granted permission to specify their own responses, and different
responses can be sent depending on host and port pairs.  oidentd features
a capability-based permission system that allows system administrators fine-
grained control over which functionalities may be used by each user.

For more information on the operating system kernels oidentd supports,
consult the KERNEL_SUPPORT.md file.

For a complete list of features, consult the manual pages or run
oidentd --help.

The most recent version of oidentd will always be available at
https://files.janikrabe.com/pub/oidentd/releases/latest.
